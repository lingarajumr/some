    <dt><b><h2>HTML</h2></b></dt>
    <dd>An HTML description typically refers to a brief explanation or summary of what a specific HTML element or structure does. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating webpages and web applications.

        Here are some key aspects of HTML:
        
        HTML Structure: HTML is made up of elements that are enclosed in "tags." These tags tell the browser how to display content.</dd>
        <dt><b><h2>CSS</h2></b></dt>
        <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation (the look and feel) of a web page written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of a webpage. While HTML handles the structure and content of a web page, CSS is used to style and make it visually appealing.
            <dt><b><h2>JS</h2></b></dt>
            <dd>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects and functionalities on websites. It is one of the three core technologies of the web, alongside HTML (for structure) and CSS (for style). JavaScript allows developers to add behavior to web pages, making them interactive and responsive to user actions.</dd>
